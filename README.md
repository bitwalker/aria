# Aria

Aria is an ML-style programming language, in the vein of OCaml, but with my
take on syntax and features. In short:

- Interpreted, but with the option for native-code compilation
- First class polymorphism
- Functors/first-class modules, like OCaml
- Sum/product types
- Actor-based concurrency model
- FFI
- Macros
- A strong, but conservative standard library, like Go
- First-class tooling for testing/documentation, like Elixir

I'm currently working through the design phase, and have some toy implementations,
but will wait to push anything until I'm feeling good about the core of what's built.
I plan to post my notes as I go along.
